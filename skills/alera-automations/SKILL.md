# Alera Automations

Use `alera automation` for scheduled agent work. Automations are definitions; runs are individual executions. Orchestration tasks are separate and use `alera-orchestration`.

## Authoring

Choose the execution target explicitly. Never infer a target type. Once chosen, `--workspace-id`, `--profile-id`, and origin can come from the current Alera terminal environment. A profile, prompt, schedule, and valid target are enough; no repository declaration, profile permission, or approval step is required. Creation is Active unless `--draft` is supplied. Editing an Active automation keeps it Active and affects future runs.

```bash
alera automation --json create --name 'Daily Review' --prompt 'Review changed files and report findings' --cron '0 9 * * 1-5' --timezone America/Mexico_City --target fresh-tab --request-key daily-review
alera automation --json create --file automation.json --dry-run
alera automation --json edit --id <id> --prompt-file prompt.txt --expected-revision <revision>
alera automation --json list --workspace-id <workspace-id>
alera automation --json show --id <id>
alera automation run-now --id <id>
alera automation pause --id <id> --active-runs continue-active
alera automation resume --id <id>
```

Use a stable `--request-key` when retrying creation after an ambiguous response. `--dry-run` checks readiness without saving. `preview-schedule --cron '0 9 * * *' --timezone UTC` previews dates. Read [targets and JSON](references/authoring.md) for other targets and advanced settings. Use `alera automation <command> --help` for optional flags.

## Execution

A runtime must be running for schedules to fire. Creating an automation does not enable login autostart or change keep-runtime settings. The default skips occurrences missed while offline. Already admitted runs recover separately: reconcile their owner, resume the native conversation when possible, then retry with context in the preserved workspace. Recovery has three total launches, 60/120 second backoff, and the original 24-hour deadline. Unreachable SSH owners remain reserved until closure can be verified; do not launch a replacement manually into the same target while ownership is unknown.

Watching a terminal is read-only. Take Over stops automatic recovery and preserves the workspace. Use it only when the user intends to operate that agent.

## When You Are Running An Automation

`ALERA_AUTOMATION_RUN_ID` and `ALERA_AUTOMATION_ATTEMPT_ID` bind lifecycle calls to the current attempt. The CLI supplies the target identity from the terminal environment. Keep those variables intact.

```bash
alera automation --json context --run "$ALERA_AUTOMATION_RUN_ID"
alera automation heartbeat --run "$ALERA_AUTOMATION_RUN_ID"
alera automation complete --run "$ALERA_AUTOMATION_RUN_ID" --status success --summary 'Describe the result and verification'
```

Report progress during long work. Complete once with a useful summary and `success`, `failure`, or `blocked`. A superseded attempt must stop lifecycle writes. Before retrying external effects, inspect existing results to avoid repeating them.
