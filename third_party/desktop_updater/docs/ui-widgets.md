# Ready-Made UI Widgets

desktop_updater ships several UI surfaces on purpose. They all read the same
`DesktopUpdaterController` state, but they fit different app shells: a plain
`Scaffold` body, an existing `CustomScrollView`, a modal update prompt, or a
fully custom product surface.

This split keeps update mechanics consistent without forcing every desktop app
to restructure its layout. The ready-made widgets stay hidden while the updater
is idle or the user has skipped the version, then appear only when there is an
actionable update state.

## Why There Are Multiple Widgets

- Some apps need an inline card above their main content.
- Some apps already own their scroll view and only need a sliver.
- Some apps want an interruptive dialog for important update prompts.
- Some apps need custom UI but still want the package to provide state and
  actions.
- The same controller state drives every surface, so download, skip, restart,
  mandatory update, and failure behavior stays aligned.

## `DesktopUpdateWidget`

`DesktopUpdateWidget` is the simplest stock wrapper. It creates a
`CustomScrollView`, places `DesktopUpdateSliver` first, and renders your child
below it.

![DesktopUpdateWidget screenshot](assets/ui-widgets/desktop-update-widget.png)

Use it when your screen can let the updater own the top-level scroll container.
It is best for simple pages, settings screens, or apps that do not already have
a custom sliver layout.

```dart
DesktopUpdateWidget(
  controller: controller,
  child: const YourHomePage(),
)
```

Why it exists: the common "show update UI above my app content" case should be
one widget, not a hand-built `CustomScrollView` in every app.

## `DesktopUpdateSliver`

`DesktopUpdateSliver` is the scroll-native version. It reveals the same stock
card inside a large sliver app bar when the controller is in an active update
state.

![DesktopUpdateSliver screenshot](assets/ui-widgets/desktop-update-sliver.png)

Use it when your app already uses a `CustomScrollView` and you want the update
surface to participate in the same scroll layout as the rest of the page.

```dart
CustomScrollView(
  slivers: [
    DesktopUpdateSliver(controller: controller),
    const SliverToBoxAdapter(child: YourHomePage()),
  ],
)
```

Why it exists: sliver-based desktop screens should not need an extra nested
scroll view just to show update UI.

## `DesktopUpdateDirectCard`

`DesktopUpdateDirectCard` shows the stock card exactly where you place it. It
wraps `UpdateCard` in `DesktopUpdaterInheritedNotifier`, so you can drop it into
an existing `Column`, `ListView`, side panel, settings page, or dashboard slot.

![DesktopUpdateDirectCard screenshot](assets/ui-widgets/desktop-update-direct-card.png)

Use it when your app already owns the page structure and you only want the
updater card as one child in that structure.

```dart
Column(
  children: [
    DesktopUpdateDirectCard(controller: controller),
    const Expanded(child: YourHomePage()),
  ],
)
```

Why it exists: many desktop apps already have a layout and should not have to
adopt the package's scroll wrapper to use the stock UI.

## `UpdateCard`

`UpdateCard` is the shared Material card used by the direct card and sliver
surfaces. It can read an explicit `controller` or the nearest
`DesktopUpdaterInheritedNotifier`.

Use it directly when you need tighter control over inherited scope or card
margin:

```dart
DesktopUpdaterInheritedNotifier(
  controller: controller,
  child: const UpdateCard(
    margin: EdgeInsets.all(12),
  ),
)
```

Why it exists: it keeps the visual card implementation reusable while the
wrapper widgets handle placement.

`UpdateCard` switches its actions from the typed update state:

- `UpdateAvailable`: shows download and, when optional, skip actions.
- `UpdateFreshInstallRequired`: shows the fresh-install message and
  `Download latest` action instead of in-app download.
- `UpdateBlockedBySupportPolicy`: shows blocking required-update UI and hides
  skip actions.
- `UpdateDownloading`: shows a progress action.
- `UpdateReadyToInstall`: shows the restart/install action. Optional releases
  keep the normal "Not now" restart prompt. Mandatory releases keep the staged
  update active, hide "Not now", and show "Save first" plus "Restart" so users
  can save unsaved work without skipping the required update.
- `UpdateFailed`: shows a retry action and, when a diagnostics report exists,
  a "View report" action.

## Release Notes Patterns

Release notes are an optional controller capability attached to the selected
update descriptor. The built-in card and custom UI should both use
`controller.loadReleaseNotes()` rather than fetching notes directly in a widget.

Do not fetch release notes directly from a widget when the controller already
has a loader. Use the controller so caching, retry state, descriptor context,
and ready-made UI stay aligned.

### Built-in card and bottom sheet

Pass either a descriptor-aware loader or a simple URL. The stock card shows a
description icon when the active update can load notes, then opens a Material
bottom sheet:

```dart
final controller = DesktopUpdaterController(
  appArchiveUrl: archiveUrl,
  releaseNotesLoader: (descriptor) {
    return myNotesApi.fetch(
      version: descriptor.version,
      platform: descriptor.platform,
      channel: descriptor.channel,
    );
  },
);

DesktopUpdateDirectCard(controller: controller);
```

Simple hosted notes can use `releaseNotesUrl` instead:

```dart
final controller = DesktopUpdaterController(
  appArchiveUrl: archiveUrl,
  releaseNotesUrl: Uri.parse("https://updates.example.com/release-notes.json"),
);
```

### Inline panel

Inline panels work well inside Settings > Updates, where the app already has
room to show the changelog below the update actions:

```dart
Future<void> loadInlineNotes() async {
  final notes = await controller.loadReleaseNotes();
  setState(() => visibleNotes = notes);
}
```

Render from `controller.releaseNotesState` so loading, empty, loaded, and failed
states stay consistent with the built-in bottom sheet.

### Side sheet

For wide desktop layouts, keep update actions in the main pane and open notes
in a side sheet or drawer:

```dart
Future<void> openSideSheet(BuildContext context) async {
  final notes = await controller.loadReleaseNotes();
  if (!context.mounted) return;
  showDialog<void>(
    context: context,
    builder: (_) => Dialog(
      alignment: Alignment.centerRight,
      child: ReleaseNotesSidePane(notes: notes),
    ),
  );
}
```

### Changelog page

A dedicated changelog page is useful when Settings already has an Updates tab.
The page can request notes on entry, retry through
`controller.loadReleaseNotes(forceRefresh: true)`, and keep the rest of the
update flow on the same controller:

```dart
class ChangelogPage extends StatelessWidget {
  const ChangelogPage({super.key, required this.controller});

  final DesktopUpdaterController controller;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListenableBuilder(
      listenable: controller,
      builder: (context, _) {
        return switch (controller.releaseNotesState) {
          ReleaseNotesLoaded(:final notes) => NotesList(notes: notes),
          ReleaseNotesFailed() => TextButton(
              onPressed: () {
                controller.loadReleaseNotes(forceRefresh: true);
              },
              child: const Text("Retry"),
            ),
          _ => const CircularProgressIndicator(),
        };
      },
    );
  }
}
```

## `UpdateDialogListener` And Dialog Helpers

`UpdateDialogListener` is an invisible listener. Place it in your widget tree and
it opens `UpdateDialogWidget` after the current frame when an update becomes
available.

![UpdateDialogWidget screenshot](assets/ui-widgets/update-dialog-widget.png)

Use it when an available update should become a modal prompt instead of an
inline surface.

```dart
Stack(
  children: [
    const YourHomePage(),
    UpdateDialogListener(controller: controller),
  ],
)
```

Why it exists: some apps want update discovery to interrupt the current screen,
while others prefer quiet inline UI. The listener keeps that choice explicit.
It also guards against duplicate dialogs while the same update request is
already being shown.

Mandatory update dialogs are intentionally not the same as optional restart
prompts. A mandatory release removes skip and "Not now" choices, but still keeps
a "Save first" action in the restart confirmation by default. In
`UpdateDialogListener`, that action dismisses the modal update flow so the user
can return to the app and save work; it does not persist a skipped version.

If a dialog-based integration should restart without the extra confirmation,
pass `mandatoryReadyToInstallBehavior:
MandatoryReadyToInstallBehavior.restartWithoutPrompt` to
`UpdateDialogListener` or `showUpdateDialog()`.

Fresh-install dialogs use the package default copy plus the optional
release-specific `freshInstall.message`, and route users to `Download latest`.
Support-policy blocking dialogs are not dismissible through the ready-made
listener.

You can also open the dialog yourself:

```dart
await showUpdateDialog<void>(
  context,
  controller: controller,
  mandatoryReadyToInstallBehavior:
      MandatoryReadyToInstallBehavior.restartWithoutPrompt,
);
```

For user-triggered update checks, use `checkForUpdates()` and show feedback for
all outcomes:

```dart
final result = await controller.checkForUpdates();

await showManualUpdateCheckResultDialog(
  context,
  controller: controller,
  result: result,
);
```

Why this helper exists: automatic startup checks should usually stay quiet when
nothing is available, but a manual "Check for updates" button should still be
able to tell the user "up to date" or "check failed".

Automatic startup checks also stay quiet when the version check itself fails.
The controller still moves to `UpdateFailed`, so inline surfaces and custom
state UI can show retry affordances, but the initial `init()` check does not
throw into app startup. For strict flows, explicitly `await
controller.checkVersion()` and handle the thrown error. For user-triggered
checks, prefer `checkForUpdates()`, which returns `ManualUpdateCheckFailed`
instead of throwing.

## Update Problem Reports

When a check, download, verification, staging, or install handoff fails, the
controller builds a local `UpdateProblemReport` and attaches it to
`UpdateFailed.report`. The report is kept in memory, bounded to a safe entry
count, and redacted before `toPlainText()` is copied or exported. The package
does not write report files, upload logs, or include a reporting backend.

Stock UI shows "View report" only when `UpdateFailed.report` is available. The
dialog starts with a short user-facing summary, keeps technical details
collapsed, and lets the user copy the redacted report. The "Report issue" action
is hidden unless your app supplies `onProblemReport`.

```dart
final controller = DesktopUpdaterController(
  appArchiveUrl: archiveUrl,
  onProblemReport: (report) async {
    await myIssueReporter.send(report.toPlainText());
  },
);
```

Use `onProblemReport` for app-owned integrations such as Sentry, email,
pre-filled issue forms, customer support tickets, or your own API. It is invoked
only after an explicit user action in the report dialog.

Custom UI can open the same dialog:

```dart
if (controller.state case UpdateFailed(:final report) when report != null) {
  await showUpdateProblemReportDialog(
    context,
    controller: controller,
    report: report,
  );
}
```

## Runtime Extension Points

The controller keeps skip, retry, and telemetry behavior optional so apps do not
need to adopt a storage or analytics package just to use the updater.

Skip preferences are in-memory by default. To persist "skip this version"
across controller recreation, provide an app-owned `UpdatePreferences` adapter:

```dart
final controller = DesktopUpdaterController(
  appArchiveUrl: Uri.parse("https://updates.example.com/app-archive.json"),
  preferences: MyUpdatePreferencesStore(),
);
```

The adapter stores one skipped version per channel with
`skippedVersion({required channel})`,
`skipVersion({required version, required channel})`, and
`clearSkippedVersion({required channel})`. Mandatory updates ignore skipped
versions.

Staged rollouts use an app-owned stable identity. Pass an opaque
`installationIdentity` when you want `rollout.percentage` metadata in
`app-archive.json` to filter update eligibility:

```dart
final controller = DesktopUpdaterController(
  appArchiveUrl: archiveUrl,
  installationIdentity: myInstallIdentity,
);
```

Use a generated install ID or hashed app-owned identifier. Avoid emails, license
keys, names, or support IDs. Without an identity, partial rollout items are
ignored; full rollout and non-rollout items still work normally.

Telemetry is also app-owned. Pass a callback to receive typed lifecycle events
such as `checkStarted`, `checkFailed`, `updateSelected`, `downloadStarted`,
`downloadFailed`, `artifactVerified`, `installScheduled`, and `installFailed`:

```dart
final controller = DesktopUpdaterController(
  appArchiveUrl: archiveUrl,
  telemetry: (event) {
    analytics.record("desktop_update_${event.type.name}");
  },
);
```

Telemetry callback failures are ignored by the updater. The callback is for
observation only and is never required for update checks, downloads, or install
handoff.

Install scheduling also keeps a small cleanup report in memory. Read
`controller.lastCleanupReport` after `restartApp()` or pass `onCleanupReport`
to persist the staging path, descriptor version, cleanup status, native rollback
status when known, and error text when scheduling or cleanup fails:

```dart
final controller = DesktopUpdaterController(
  appArchiveUrl: archiveUrl,
  onCleanupReport: (report) async {
    await myReleaseAuditStore.save(report);
  },
);
```

The callback is observational. If it throws or your persistence backend is
unavailable, the updater still treats install scheduling according to the
native helper result.

### Diagnostics And Support

Apps that want a durable lifecycle log can supply an app-owned diagnostics
recorder with a sink. The package forwards redacted entries but does not choose
a file path, retention policy, upload target, or storage package:

```dart
class AppUpdateLogSink implements UpdateDiagnosticsSink {
  AppUpdateLogSink(this.file);
  final File file;

  @override
  void record(UpdateDiagnosticEntry entry) {
    file.writeAsStringSync(
      "${entry.toRedactedLogLine()}\n",
      mode: FileMode.append,
      flush: true,
    );
  }
}

final controller = DesktopUpdaterController(
  appArchiveUrl: archiveUrl,
  diagnosticsRecorder: UpdateDiagnosticsRecorder(
    sink: AppUpdateLogSink(appOwnedLogFile),
  ),
);
```

Sink failures are ignored by the updater. In-memory problem reports remain
available even when the app-owned log destination cannot be written.

Apps can also opt into a pending install recovery marker. The package never
chooses a marker file, database, or retention policy; provide an app-owned
`UpdateRecoveryStore` when you want post-relaunch install failure reports:

```dart
class AppUpdateRecoveryStore implements UpdateRecoveryStore {
  @override
  Future<UpdateInstallRecoveryMarker?> readPendingInstall({
    required String channel,
  }) async {
    return myStore.readMarker(channel);
  }

  @override
  Future<void> writePendingInstall(
    UpdateInstallRecoveryMarker marker,
  ) async {
    await myStore.writeMarker(marker.channel, marker);
  }

  @override
  Future<void> clearPendingInstall({required String channel}) async {
    await myStore.deleteMarker(channel);
  }
}

final controller = DesktopUpdaterController(
  appArchiveUrl: archiveUrl,
  recoveryStore: AppUpdateRecoveryStore(),
);
```

Before native install handoff, `restartApp()` writes a marker with the current
app version, target update version/build, staging path, and redacted diagnostics
text. If the native method throws before the app exits, the marker is cleared
and the current-session `UpdateFailed(report)` is preserved. On relaunch,
`recoverPendingInstall()` reads the marker: a target version match clears it,
while the old version or an unverifiable version becomes `UpdateFailed(report)`.
Store failures are captured as diagnostics warnings and do not crash startup or
block install handoff.

For post-exit native helper diagnostics, pass an explicit app-owned log path.
The helpers append bounded JSONL-style lifecycle events only when a path is
provided; logging failures are ignored so update install and rollback work are
not blocked by support logging:

```dart
final controller = DesktopUpdaterController(
  appArchiveUrl: archiveUrl,
  diagnosticsLogPath: appOwnedHelperLogFile.path,
);
```

Use this with an app-owned recovery store when support needs evidence from
after the Flutter process has exited.

For support flows, keep the integration level explicit:

1. In-memory problem report only: this is the default. The package writes no
   files and uploads nothing.
2. App-owned Dart lifecycle log: add `UpdateDiagnosticsRecorder(sink: ...)`
   when your app wants a redacted durable log at a path it controls.
3. App-owned native helper log plus recovery store: add `diagnosticsLogPath`
   and `UpdateRecoveryStore` when support needs post-exit install, rollback,
   cleanup, or relaunch evidence.

Suggested user-facing support copy:

```text
Open Settings > Updates > Copy update report. If the app cannot open that
screen, attach the update log from the location your app shows in Settings.
```

Do not hardcode a package-owned support path. The app should choose the path,
retention behavior, and whether the user approves sharing the file.

See [Diagnostics and recovery](diagnostics-and-recovery.md) for the full log
location, native helper, and recovery-store model.

If your app wants to enforce descriptor `minimumOS` metadata, provide a
deterministic policy callback:

```dart
final controller = DesktopUpdaterController(
  appArchiveUrl: archiveUrl,
  isMinimumOSSupported: ({required platform, required minimumOS}) {
    return myRuntimePolicy.supports(platform, minimumOS);
  },
);
```

When the callback returns false for the current platform, the descriptor is
skipped. If no callback is supplied, `minimumOS` is parsed and preserved but not
enforced by the controller.

## Custom UI With `DesktopUpdaterInheritedNotifier`

For product-specific UI, wrap your own widget with
`DesktopUpdaterInheritedNotifier` and switch on the typed controller state.

![Custom update UI screenshot](assets/ui-widgets/custom-state-ui.png)

```dart
DesktopUpdaterInheritedNotifier(
  controller: controller,
  child: Builder(
    builder: (context) {
      final updater = DesktopUpdaterInheritedNotifier.of(context).notifier!;

      return switch (updater.state) {
        UpdateAvailable(:final mandatory) => ListTile(
            title: Text(mandatory ? "Required update" : "Update available"),
            subtitle: Text("${updater.appName} ${updater.appVersion}"),
            trailing: FilledButton(
              onPressed: updater.downloadUpdate,
              child: const Text("Download"),
            ),
          ),
        UpdateDownloading(:final receivedBytes, :final totalBytes) =>
          LinearProgressIndicator(
            value: totalBytes <= 0 ? null : receivedBytes / totalBytes,
          ),
        UpdateReadyToInstall() => FilledButton(
            onPressed: updater.restartApp,
            child: const Text("Install"),
          ),
        UpdateFailed(:final error) => Text("Update failed: $error"),
        _ => const SizedBox.shrink(),
      };
    },
  ),
)
```

Why it exists: package defaults are useful for fast adoption, but desktop apps
often need the update prompt to match their own navigation, density, and visual
language.

## Visibility Rules

| Surface | Visible for | Hidden for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DesktopUpdateWidget` | Whatever `DesktopUpdateSliver` shows | Idle or skipped updates |
| `DesktopUpdateSliver` | Available, downloading, ready to install | Idle, skipped, failed |
| `DesktopUpdateDirectCard` | Available, downloading, ready to install, failed | Idle or skipped updates |
| `UpdateCard` | Available, downloading, ready to install, failed | Idle or skipped updates |
| `UpdateDialogListener` | Available update | Idle, skipped, downloading, ready, failed |
| Custom state UI | Whatever your `switch` returns | Whatever your `switch` hides |

Mandatory updates hide skip actions and make dialogs non-dismissible. Optional
updates keep the skip action visible so the user can dismiss the current
version.
